# Course Syllabi

I keep syllabuses from my past courses online because someone else might find them useful. Each of these is a website. Older courses were static HTML sites that I built. Newer courses are at WordPress.com. The most recent courses are at the top. Usually I teach two courses each semester at UF.

For a synopsis of any course, open the **About** page in the syllabus. For weekly topics and links to assignments, open the **Course Schedule** page.
